# <strong> AI-Powered-Digital-Twin-for-Construction-Sites  </strong>
This project aims to develop Aquila, an AI-powered Digital Twin platform that transforms productivity and sustainability on construction sites. In collaboration with world-leading organizations like BIM Academy, XBIM, Gray Fox Consulting, Costain Group Plc, and Northumbria University, Aquila tackles key industry challenges such as low equipment utilization and resource management inefficiencies. By leveraging real-time data, AI-driven analytics, and 4D visualizations, Aquila establishes bi-directional control loops between the construction site and the project control office, enhancing decision-making for equipment usage, safety monitoring, and scheduling. This leads to significant reductions in costs, delays, and carbon emissions. Aquila’s core AI functionalities include real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and AI-assisted decision-making to optimize equipment use and work programs. The platform aligns with the UK's Industrial Decarbonization Strategy and the government’s Transforming Infrastructure Performance roadmap, supporting economic growth and environmental targets. Key milestones in the project include selecting and testing AI methods for productivity and safety monitoring, deploying cloud computing infrastructure, and integrating IoT, mobile applications, and 4D dashboard visualizations. These elements will create a comprehensive, data-driven solution tailored to the needs of the construction sector.

Finally, This work presents multi-label ActDNN, a novel neural network for activity recognition on construction sites, addressing limitations in vision-based methods reliant on large, structured datasets. ActDNN facilitates robust multi-label activity recognition through independent learning and sequential learning. In independent learning, the network was trained and tested on an independent set of frames, achieving an accuracy of 99.82%. In sequential learning, sequential information was utilized to predict the sequential activities of an excavator and two trucks, achieving prediction accuracies of 97.79%, 89.67%, and 86.48%, respectively. This study enhances vision-based methods for automating sequential activity and productivity analysis, offering scalable and efficient construction equipment monitoring.
